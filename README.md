# My dotfiles
So I don't have to redo them all the time ;)

* `git clone https://github.com/Pkallesoe/dotfiles`
* `cd ~/dotfiles && chmod +x make_symlinks.sh && ./make_symlinks.sh`

### Set up vim
* requires Vim 7.3.885+ compiled with if_lua
* `git clone https://github.com/gmarik/vundle.git ~/.vim/bundle/vundle`

### Set up zsh
* `curl -L https://raw.github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh | sh`
